# Miden Ã— OpenZeppelin: Security, Standards and Privacy

![](/images/Miden-x-OpenZeppelin.jpg)

To bring privacy and safety to real-world finance, Miden needs industry-standard smart contract security. 

And to do it right, we couldnâ€™t have found a better partner than **OpenZeppelin**, the team behind the most trusted onchain frameworks.

The collaboration strengthens Midenâ€™s ecosystem on three fronts â€“ security, standards, and private custody â€“ creating a foundation builders and institutions can rely on.

## Why OpenZeppelin

Midenâ€™s architecture moves execution and state to the client side â€“ to the edge â€“ and in doing so, enables privacy onchain.

Itâ€™s a new model, one that demands the same level of assurance enterprises expect from traditional systems.

OpenZeppelin brings that assurance.

Their frameworks and audits secure most onchain assets today. With [over $30 trillion transferred through OpenZeppelin smart contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/stats/contracts), their standards have defined how tokens, access control, and composability work across the industry.

Together, weâ€™re applying those same practices to privacy-first infrastructure.

## A strategic fit

OpenZeppelin technology sits at the core of Midenâ€™s private banking stack â€“ a curated ecosystem focused on private custody, OTC trading, and provable compliance.

Miden provides the privacy and local proving model.  
OpenZeppelin provides the security backbone and the developer standards that make it fully adoptable.

The result is an environment where builders can deploy financial applications with confidence, and where institutions can operate privately without giving up accountability when required.

Itâ€™s for institutional-grade private finance, built for the real economy.

## What it covers

The partnership is structured around three pillars.

**Token standards**: Both teams are defining Midenâ€™s fungible token standard â€“ the equivalent of ERC-20 for Miden â€“ establishing the base layer for private onchain assets.

**Private multisig and shared state**: A new multisig model will enable secure custody and shared account control in a private environment, a key requirement for funds, OTC venues, and enterprises managing significant assets.

**Security and auditing**: OpenZeppelin will review and audit core smart contracts and libraries across the Miden ecosystem to ensure institutional-grade robustness.

Together, these pieces make privacy safe, composable, and ready for scale.

### Why it matters

For builders, this partnership provides a clear framework for secure and private applications that can meet institutional expectations.

For institutions, it enables digital asset management with both privacy and accountability.

And for custodians and asset managers, it opens the door to compliant privacy â€“ a concept public blockchains were never designed for.

This is how privacy becomes practical for real-world applications.

## Whatâ€™s next

During Q4, we will roll out:

* Midenâ€™s fungible token standard (developed alongside the next Rust compiler release)  
* OpenZeppelinâ€™s early integrations and audit work  
* Joint developer resources and technical guides

Miden and OpenZeppelin will also collaborate with selected [Pioneer teams](https://x.com/0xMiden/status/1930640889875161379) to test early implementations in live environments.

The shared goal: make privacy usable, secure, and ready for real capital.

## Final words

Privacy needs infrastructure.

With OpenZeppelin, weâ€™re making that infrastructure safe for everyone building at the edge.
